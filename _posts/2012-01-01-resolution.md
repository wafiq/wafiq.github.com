This year, I determined to get serious in programming.
I [love](http://microthe.me) [doing](http://unsetup.com) <strike>and maintaining</strike> things.
With my current capability as Front-end Developer, it was somehow limited to merely interfaces and interactions.

There's not many people in this world that could cross both worlds. To be able to do things as you will, would
open up a lot of potential. You can take your own career path, be independent, be productive,
and probably you could do more traveling.

So, here's my resolution for 2012:

1. Be independent in Ruby, subsequently Ruby on Rails.

2. Deep understanding in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

3. Learn new programming languages (Python, Objective C)

3. Launch at least three good personal projects.

4. Create first marketable iOS App.

5. Lean body. BMI > 25.

6. Be Money-problem Free (go ahead, BFM, that's a good one).

Well, the last two isn't related to programming. Nevertheless,
it's a worthy point to have in concurrent to the rest of the point.
